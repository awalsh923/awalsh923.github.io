        <p>About Me</p>
        <p>I am a second year student studying Business at Wilfrid Laurier University and Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I have a passion for both and am currently learning web development in my free time, part of the reason I made this website! I have completed a co-op working as a Jr Project Coordinator for the Wilfrid Laurier Project Management Office where I conducted requirement gathering sessions, configured systems, and conducted testing phases. In my free time, I love to cook and learn how to make different dishes.</p>
